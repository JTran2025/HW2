COMP 4610 GUI I

## Description
This project begins with an html and css file. The goal of this project is to take the css file and style the html file to look approximately like the picture of the webpage in the HW2.pdf file without changing anything in the html file.

## Features
I made the background by setting the background image to the gradient picture and then extending the gradient all the way to the bottom by setting the background color.

For the #wrapper element, I set the width to 80% to be 80% of the page and set the minimum width to be 600px. I centered the body of the page by setting the left and right margin to auto.

I made the nav bar by making nav float left and putting a fixed width of 190 pixels. In order to extend the height of the nav bar, I essentially made it the background of the content and set the background color to be light blue. This was so that when the webpage shrinks and grows depending on the size of the webpage, then the nav bar will change with the height of the content.

The nav list links had the button symbols and underlines removed. The font color was changed and the font weight was set to bold. A padding was placed around the entire list away from the default top left corner. The links change to white when the mouse hovers over them and change to a different color when they are visited

For the h1, the background is an image that is set to not repeat and placed to the right. The background color is set to be the same color as the left hand side of the image to give it the illusion that the image is extended. The color of the h1 text is set to white.

In the #content element, the img is set to float left in order for text to wrap around it. The background color of this element is set to white and the left margin is set to 190 pixels in order to place the contents to the right of the nav bar. The bullet point symbols of the list are changed. The list and the symbols are set to be aligned with the rest of the text.

The resort class has its font color changes and font weight set to bold in order to stand out in the text.

The text in the footer is made smaller and was given margins to be placed right of the nav bar.

## Issues
Although I made everything look similar, I struggled a lot with the nav bar and believe there is a more efficient way of going about it.
